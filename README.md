# FirstPersonShooter

# What is it about?

The game begins with a nice menu for him to play, so that he begins to play killing the enemies that appear on the scene with the help of the gun that the player has and also survive if I know that the pickups are without bullets (life and ammunition), if you are low on life you can use the life pickup that is on the map and if you have very little ammunition go and take the bullet pickup

# what did I do

# why I made the game?

I made this game to acquire knowledge that I need to explore with unity since this engine is great and helps a lot in the creation of video games thanks to this game I was able to learn how to add particles to things, sounds and an options menu where I could control the volume and the full screen, which is saved

# briefly explain the game?

The game is about a player with a life of 50, a number of bullets of 60 with a pistol, a score when killing an enemy, with pickup of life and bullets, and with some enemies who want to kill the player so that the player defends himself and survive with hordes of enemies

game data
Player: 50 health, 60 start and 60 max bullets, 6 move, 8 jump, 0.4 shot delay
Enemy: 10 health, infinite bullets, 5 speed, 4 attack range, 0.5 shot delay
pickup:
Health: Increases player's health by 15

Create a game menu and an options menu so you can change the options to your liking

The Win menu appears when you kill all the enemies that were in the level and the GameOver menu appears when the enemies kill you
